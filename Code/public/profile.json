  "futurePlans": "Upon graduation in 2025, I aim to secure a position in the Western Cape, where I can apply my computer science expertise and continue growing professionally in an environment I deeply appreciate.\n\nI'm eager to transition into independent living with my fiancée, establishing our home together and building our future. This includes pursuing personal projects I've been planning, particularly in electronics and embedded systems development.\n\nBeyond my professional aspirations, I look forward to welcoming a dog into our home - something our previous schedules never permitted but has always been a goal. Long-term, after establishing financial stability, I plan to marry my fiancée and continue developing both personally and professionally in the Western Cape tech community."
