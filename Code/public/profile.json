  "futurePlans": "I plan to start working as soon as possible after I graduate, to be able to move out. I would like to find work in the Western Cape, because I love it here and would like to stay here. There are a few electronics projects that I have been wanting to do for a while that I want to do. Growing up we never had dogs (our schedules didn't allow it) and I would like to get a dog. Then later down the line I would like to get married to my fiancée (after we saved up some money).\nI am super excited about it."
