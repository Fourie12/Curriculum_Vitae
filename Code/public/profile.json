  "futurePlans": "Upon graduation in 2025, I'm eager to begin my career as a software engineer in the Western Cape. I'm particularly drawn to roles involving backend systems, distributed architecture, or full-stack development where I can apply my experience with network programming, compiler design, and system-level coding.
  
  Alongside my career, I'm excited to transition into independent living with my fiancée and pursue the personal projects I've been planning—particularly in electronics and embedded systems. After establishing financial stability, we plan to marry and welcome a dog into our home.

I'm committed to growing professionally in the Western Cape tech community while building a fulfilling personal life in a region I deeply appreciate."
